## HTML Links
Pretty much any website you go to now a days has either an internal or external link you can click on. Links are important parts of websites and making sure you know how to proper create one in HTML is vital.

You create links using ```<a></a>``` tags.

The ```href``` attribute is the link you will be sending the user to.

For external linking sites do this:

```
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```

For intermal linking sites do this:

```
<a href="index.html">Home</a>
```

With this basic knowledge you could be well on your way to creating many links around your first site and to other sites too.

## HTML Layout
The layout of a website can make or break a site. If it is not clear where the eyes should flow you rish the user leaving your site and never coming back.

A good place to start with HTML layout is with semantic items.

### Some Semantic Elements

1. ```<header>```
2. ```<nav>```
3. ```<section>```
4. ```<article>```
5. ```<footer>```

These sections help clearly define the layout of a website and where your text and images can go.

- In order for a function to work you need to "call it" or render the function beneath it.
- The parameters of a function are information that is passed through to the function
- When you need or want a response from your function it is called a return value.
