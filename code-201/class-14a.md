## CSS Transforms
When you are styling your website you can add some cool styling via CSS. One option you can use is the CSS transform. By using Transform and adding pixels you can move the thing you're trying to move anywhere on the page.

```
transform: none;
```
This will remove any transformation.

```
transform: translateX(40px);
```
This will move the element on the **horizontal** axis.

```
transform: translateY(20px);
```
This will move the element on the **vertical** axis.

## CSS Transitions & Animations
CSS transitions and animations can add a new dimension to your website. The transition property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties.

### Transitions

1. Property
2. Duration
3. Timing Function
4. Delay

These transition  properties allow elements to change values over a specified duration, animating the property changes, rather than having them occur immediately.

## Animations
The animation property in CSS can be used to animate many other CSS properties such as color, background-color, height, or width.

### Sub-properties for Animations

- animation-name: declares the name of the @keyframes at-rule to manipulate.

- animation-duration: the length of time it takes for an animation to complete one cycle.

- animation-timing-function: establishes preset acceleration curves such as ease or linear.
