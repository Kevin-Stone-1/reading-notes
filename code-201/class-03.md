## HTML Lists
Lists help create a lot of order and cleanliness on an HTML page. There are three types of lists to cover.

### Three Types of Lists

1. Numbered Lists
2. Bulleted lists
3. Definition lists

When you write a list you also have list items within that list. For instance the list items from the list above are the "numbered lists", "bulleted lists", and "definition lists".

**In HTML list items are created by**
```<li></li>``` **tags.**

### Ordered lists
Ordered lists are lists that have a number in front of each list item.

```
<ol>
    <li></li>
</ol>
```

### Unordered lists
Unordered lists are lists that have a bullet point in front of each list item.

```
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
```

### Nested lists
Within a list you can create other sublists or nested lists within the original list by using the tags from above.

### Switch Statements
Switch statements begin with a switch value that indicates an optional value that cna run if that value matches.

### Truthy & Falsey
JavaScript is a "weak typing" language because the data type of some value can change. This allows things to become Truthy Falsey. Where practically anything can be taken as true or false.

### Loops
Loops help check a condition then returns something once the loop is completed and ran.

### Three types of Loops

1. For loops - knows when to stop loop
2. While loops - does not know when to end loop
