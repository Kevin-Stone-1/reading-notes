## Layout
Layouts are essential in making a website and building out a proper working web app. Page layout is the part of graphic design that deals with the arrangement of visual elements on a page. Page layout is used to make the web pages look better. It establishes the overall appearance, relative importance, and relationships between the graphic elements to achieve a smooth flow of information.

### Page layout:

- Header
- Nav Bar
- Sidebar
- Content
- Footer

The header tag is used to add a header section to the top of the webpage.

The Nav Bar is similar to a menu list. It is used to disply content and information with hyperlinks to get around the website easily.

The sidebar holds more information and or ads.

The content section is the place where the main content is displayed.

The footer section contains the contact information and can also serve as a navigable place as well.

When designing websites you can also have the styling of CSS. When creating CSS you can link multiple stylesheets in one page if need be.

Grids help the layout of many sites to become more flexible and professional looking.

Many websites can stretch or be rigid just by the CSS and HTML you create with them.
