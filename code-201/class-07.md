## Domain Modeling

Is simply abstract modeling. 

There are three types of objects known throughout domain modeling.

1. Boundary objects
2. Controller objects
3. Entity objects

Boundary objects are areas in which the actors move.

Entity objects like to hold onto information and file them away.

Entity objects coordinate the activites of a collection of objects.

## HTML Tables
Tables help create the web and make it readable to all. Tables are a must know when it comes to being a web developer.

In order to create a table in HTML you will need ot use the ```<table>```.

When you want to put values into a table you must use the ```<tr>``` tag to setp up your table rows.

Now that you have a table and table rows you can put data into the tbale using the ```<td>``` element and if it is a header you can use the ```<th>``` element.

By using something called the 'rowspan' and 'colspan' you can make cells of a table go more than one row.

If you have a long table splitting it up could help. You cna do this by using the ```<thead> <tbody>``` and ```<tfoot>``` elements.

## JS Functions Methods and Objects

JavaScript has many built in functions that helps make the programmers life easier.

1. Math
2. Date
3. Number
4. String

Functions help create code that you can reuse later. Functions can also take in parameters and raturn values based off of that parameter.

Objects are things that consist of a series of variables and functions that you get to input.
