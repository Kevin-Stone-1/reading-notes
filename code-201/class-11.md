## HTML Images
The web pages use to only contain textual contents, which made them appear quite boring and uninteresting. Now with images, we can create more beautiful sites using HTML.

## There are 2 ways to insert the images into a webpage:

1. By providing a full path or address (URL) to access an internet file.
2. By providing the file path relative to the location of the current web page file.

The ```<img>``` tag is used to add or embed the images to a webpage/website. The “img” tag is an empty tag, which means it can contain only a list of attributes and it has no closing tag.

## Image Tag Syntax

```
<img src="url" alt="some text" width="" height="">
```

- src: It is used to specify the path to the image.

- alt: It is used to specify an alternate text for the image. It is useful as it informs the user about what the image means and also due to any network issue if the image cannot be displayed then this alternate text will be displayed.

- height: It is used to specify the height of the image.

- width: It is used to specify the width of the image.
