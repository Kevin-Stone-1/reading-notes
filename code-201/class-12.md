## The "Canvas" Tag

The HTML ```<canvas>``` tag is an HTML5 element that is used as a container to draw graphics such as 2D objects and bitmap images in an HTML document. The actual graphics within this container are drawn using ```<script>``` tags. This tag is also commonly referred to as the ```<canvas>``` element.

The specific attributes of the 'canvas' element are height and width.

### Canvas example

```
<canvas width="125" height="125"></canvas>
```

The HTML ```<canvas>``` element is found within the ```<body>``` tag.

The ```<canvas>``` tag acts as a container for the graphics. All graphics are drawn outside of the ```<canvas>``` tag using a ```<script>``` tag with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API.

A few shapes can be drawn directly using the ```<canvas>``` element. Shapes such as circles and rectangles.

You can also use colors while working within the ```<canvas>``` element and draw text.
