## Error Handling & Debugging in JS
In any type of coding you will run into errors and will need to be able to know the error and be able to debug them.

There are common errors:

1. Syntax Errors
2. Type Errors
3. Logical Errors aka Layer 8 Errors

The Syntax error is a type of error that is thrown when there is a typo in the code creating invalid code that the computer cannot understand.

The Type error is a type of error that gets thrown when an attempt is made to perform an operation on a value of the incorrect type.

The Logical errors are thrown when the logic of a function is not valid.

## Debugging in JavaScript

DevTools help provide the developer with a lot of different tools to perform debugging tasks, including DOM inspection, profiling and things such as network inspections.

When it comes to debugging ```console.log()``` is a JavaScript developers best friend. ```console.log()``` will allow you to log to the console a number a function or a string which can prove crucial when validating your code is actually working.

Within your DevTools you can use a *breakpoint* in order to help find where your code is breaking. Breakpoints are the logical point you want the code execution to stop, so that you can debug it.
