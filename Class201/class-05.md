## HTML Images
Images help make a site pop. they also help add context to what you are saying. knowing and learning how to use them is paramount in becoming a developer.

In order to add an image to your HTML site you will need to use image tags like these ```<img />```. Here you can see the image tag is a self closing one.

When you add a source to your image tag it will actually render something. It should look like this:

```
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Jimmy_Butler_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Jimmy_Butler_%28cropped%29.jpg" />
```

You can also add a title ike this:

```
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Jimmy_Butler_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Jimmy_Butler_%28cropped%29.jpg" title="Jimmy Butler running down the court" />
```

The last thing you might want to be able to od with an image is adjust the height and width of it. You can also do this inside the tag:

```
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Jimmy_Butler_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Jimmy_Butler_%28cropped%29.jpg" title="Jimmy Butler running down the court" width="300" height="250"/>
```


## CSS Color
Adding color to a site helps draw eyes and attention to the places you want them to go.

There are a multitude of ways you can get color on your HTML page. We will look at three.

### Three ways to Color your HTML

1. Color names
2. RGB values
3. Hex code

### Color names

```
h3 {
    color: blue;
}
```

### Hex values
  
```
h3 {
    color: #bb3a19;
}
```

### RGB Values

```
h3 {
    color: rgb(200,50,50);
}
```

With these basic color types you can create a website that captivates and lures in users.

## CSS Text
Now that you know how to style your text with color you can now add size, italics, bold, and much more to create the perfect site.

There are many properties that you can use to control the font, suze, and style of your text.

## JPEG PNG & GIF
Do you know the difference between the different files JPEG, PNG, and GIF?

"Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations."
