## What is a Problem Domain in Software Engineering?
A problem domain is the stuff that has nothing to do with the language you are programming in but still must understand in order to write code. For instance, in order to create a guessing game site about sports teams you must know what a guessing game is and who the sports teams are before writing a line of code.

The reason you need to know the problem doamin is because is software engineering you will be dealing with different domains and problems throughout your career. In order to be successful you must be able to know the problem domain forwards and backwards and try and make it more simple.

In software engineering you must always be willing to learn about new things in depth so you can create the best software possible.

## Primitive Values and Object References in Javascript
All data types in JavaScript can be distilled down to two categories:

- primitive values
- object references

## What is the difference between mutable and immutable?
Mutable means that it - the data - can be channged whereas immutable means that opposite, it cannot be changed.

## Example of Immutable Data in JS
- string

## Example of Mutable Data in JS
- array


## Object Literals
An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and other values in an object which are then enclosed in some curly braces, like this ```({})```.
