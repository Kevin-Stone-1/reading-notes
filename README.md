## What Does a Growth Mindset Mean to Me?

A growth mindset means waking up everyday ready to fail, succeed, and learn. It is making sure that oneself has the grit, tenacity, and open mindset to attempt any challenge and learn from others in the process.

##### Three Reminders to Keep the Growth Mindset
1. Don't ever **give up!** 
2. Don't be afraid to *ask* for help.
3. You are going to ~~succeed everytime~~ fail, and that is ok.
