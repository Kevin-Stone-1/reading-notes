# Programming In JavaScript
In order to be proficient in JavaScript programming one must learn about Expressions, Operators, Functions, and Control Flow.

### Operators
There are assignment operators that perform assignments of variables, there are arithmetic operators that provide simple arithmetic, and many more that help solve simple problems.

#### Some Operators
- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Logical operators
- Unary operators

### Expressions
Expressions are any valid code unit that resolves to any value.

#### Some Expressions
- Primary expressions
- Lefft-hand-side expressions
- String
- Logical
- Arithmetic

### Functions
Functions are like procedures in the sense that a set of rules are created then performed on variables or inputs and then after going through the function produce an output based off those rules.

#### Example of a Function

```
function rectangle(number) {
    return number * number;
}
```

### Control flow
Is defined as the order to which the computer reads and executes the statements in a script provided to it. Usually the computer reads the code from top to bottom but sometimes when it runs into conitionals or loops it changes the control flow of the code.
