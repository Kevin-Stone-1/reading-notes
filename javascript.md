# JavaScript
JavaScript or (JS) is a "just-in-time" compiled programming language. It helps create sites that are interactive and therefore more engaging. JavaScript is NOT the same as Java.

## JavaScript Basics

### JavaScript Variables
There are three ways to declare a JS variable.

1. var
2. let
3. const

Variables allow you to store data as if they were in a box or container. In order to declare a variable you must write it like this:

```
var fName = "Kevin";
var lName = " Stone";
var fullName = fName + lName;
```

This code allows us to create simple variables and concatenate them together in order to make a full name.

### JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript has a total of eight different data types but we will go over the top three below.

1. Number - This represents integers and floating point numbers
2. String - This represents a group of characters in between "" or '' or ``
3. Boolean - This represents true or false statements

This is a quick look at some of the JavaScript basics and how to begin to build simple JS applications.
