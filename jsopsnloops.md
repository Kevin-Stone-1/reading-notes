# JS Operators & Loops

## JS Operators

- Assignment - This assigns a value to the left of the operand based off the value on its right.
```
x = y
```
- Comparison - This compares the operands and returns a value whether the value is true.
```
==
```
- Arithmetic - This allows numerical values to create another numerical value.
```
5 / 10;
```
- Bitwise - This lets the operand be a set of 32 bits rather than a decimal hexadeciaml, or octal numbers.
```
b | c
```
- Logical - This is mostly used with boolean values.
```
expression1 && expression2
```
- String - This can be used with concatenations from one string to another string.
```
console.log('this is a'  + ' string');
```
- Conditional (ternary) - This takes three operands.
```
condition ? val3 : val4
```
- Comma - This evaluates its operands and returns the last operand value.
```
var y = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
- Unary - This uses only a single operand.
```
delete Math.property;
```
- Relational - This compares the operand and returns a Boolean value based on whether the ecomparison is true or not.
```
propertyName in object
```

JavaScript has quite a few operators and these operators can be used to create functions and other statements that help sift through data in Arrays.
