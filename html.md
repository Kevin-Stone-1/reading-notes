# HTML

HTML is a simple markup language, hence the name, Hypertext Markup Language that allows you to build simple "black and white" websites. Really it is like the back bone of the site. It is your base functionality for how people are going to use your site.

## Why Wireframes and Designs are Important

Wireframes are hand-drawn or application built websites that have no color and no amazing swooping graphics, it's just the bare bones. You need to start here in order to build a functioning website that does not have any extra fluff. It helps with keeping costs low and makes sure the idea in your head is actually functional.

### Basic Steps to a Successul Wriframe & Design

1. Research
    - Do the research before you start so that your process is one fluid motion. You don't want ot be in the middle of creating the Information Architecture and remmeber you need to still research a topic more in depth. Just get it all done in the beginning. 
2. User's Experience
    - This is what it is all about. You are creating a website for a user not yourself, not your friend, but the actual demigraphic that will be using your application or site.
3. User Flow / Information Architecture
    - KISS, Keep It Simple Silly. Make sure to work out the proper flow of the website. This can easily be done with multiple sheets of paper showing the flow form one page to another from one link to the next.
4. Draft Then Draft Again
    - You're going to now make a rough draft of what you've come up with so far. This draft is going to be replaced with another draft, then another. Here you will be getting something ready to show to colleagues to make sure everything is coming together.
5. Test Test Test
    - Here you will show it to multiple colleagues and get their opinions about what needs to be changed and why they think that.
6. From Wireframe to MVP
    - Let's get a Minimal Viable Product out there and see how it works. After all the draft tests and information architactue is done. Put out everything you've learned into the product that is ready to get dressed up in color and awesome features.
