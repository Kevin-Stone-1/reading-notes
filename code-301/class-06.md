# Class 06 Reading Notes

## Node.js

1. What is node.js?

- Node.js is an asynchronous Javascript engine that uses Google's open-source V8 JavaScript engine that creates a JavaScript runtime.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

- It seems to me that Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source platform for executing JavaScript on any and every computer.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

- I think that when people say JavaScript runtime they simply mean that JavaScript can be executed on a machine.

4. What is npm?

- NPM means Node Package Manager and what it allows you to do is download JavaScript packages so that you can use libraries that are in JavaScript.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

- I am currently running npm version 6.14.14

6. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

- The simple command you need to know to install a package called 'jshint' would be:

```
npm install -g jshint
```

7. What is node used for?

- Node is used for automating the process of development for JavaScript applications.

## Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness
  (I pulled this directly from the Code Fellows Blog post at https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

- I feel in my personal experience the paired programming opportunity has allowed me to learn more and look at code through someone elses eyes. When I would have used an if else statement someone else would have written it using the switch or ternary statements. My paired programming experience has been very helpful and I have enjoyed it thus far.

3. How does pair programming work?

- Pair programming is a process in its self. You will need to be able to listen and be able to try things that sometimes you don't think will work. You will have to have an open mind and be able to also speak up or sit back when the time comes. Pair programming is a process of working as a team to accomplish a common goal.
