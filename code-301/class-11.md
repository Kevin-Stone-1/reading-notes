Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL                 | NoSQL                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Oracle, MS-SQL      | MongoDB               |
| table based DBS     | document based        |
| predefined schema   | dynamic schema        |
| relational DBs      | distributed data      |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- Good data that fit SQL databases is data that can be stacked in Apache and PHP or servier side JS using Node.js

2. Give a real world example.

- Oracle Express edition is a free SQL DB that is adaptable

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- NoSQL databases prefer JSON documents

4. Give a real world example.

- Mongo Database - Which is equipped with a dynamic schema

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- The best for heirarchical data storage is NoSQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

- Really, either one is going to get the job done but SQL is better

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

- Mongo databases are made up od JSON files

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

- MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- The compatability issues with SQL intructions
