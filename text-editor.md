# Text Editor


### What is the difference between a Text Editor and a Code Editor?
I initially thought the Text Editor and the Code Editor were the same thing; but I'm here to tell you they're not. Although they are very similar and have the same basic premise -to edit text- there are a few *key* differences.

For instance, with a **Text Editor** you get plain text with simple spacing and some other simple features such as auto-correct for spelling and grammar, easy searchability and easy replacabbilty. You will also be able to do long form writing on such editors again mostly in plain text with little to no graphics.

For the **Code Editor**, one will mostly use this tool for importing and exporting code from JSON and other files, editing it, creating multiple layers in the same folder - instead of one long "novel" in the text editor. The code editor also offers many other stylistic and automation features the simple text editor doesn't. For instance, the color coding and highlighting of code appears automatically, along with the autocompletion of programing language syntax, and the folder structures are easily managed and maintained in a simple layout where you can jump form one to the other instead of openning up multiple text editors.

All in all, the similarities are there, but the highly customizable Code Editor allows for more to be done when writing code and programs.
