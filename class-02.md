## HTML Text
Pretty much all webages have text. Text is vital for conveying a message clearly and affectively. In HTML, the developer is able to use text tags, emphasis, and structural tags to help create a website.

### Headings
There are 6 different size heading tags.

1. ```<h1>Heading Here</h1>```
2. ```<h2>Heading Here</h2>```
3. ```<h3>Heading Here</h3>```
4. ```<h4>Heading Here</h4>```
5. ```<h5>Heading Here</h5>```
6. ```<h6>Heading Here</h6>```

Starting with h1 being the largest mst important on a page and going down to h6 the smallest heading.

### Emphasis
Using the bold and italics you can emphasize a word or phrase in order to make your text more clear and more readable.

Here is how you bold and italicize:

```<b>This is bold</b>```
```<i>These are italics</i>```

There are many more text elements that can be used to help create your website structure. These are going to be your foundations. With a quick Google search you can find many more HTML text elements.

## Intro CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. They allow HTML to become colorful, more enjoyablee to look at, and visually more appealing to the eye.

CSS makes rules to specify how the HTML content should appear.

Simple CSS

```
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

This would create a text color of red for the h1 element.

Using the ```<link>``` element you can create a seperate CSS file and call it back to your HTML.

You can also do CSS in an HTML document by using the ```<style>CSS goes here</style>``` in the HTML header.


## JS Basic Javascript instructions
JavaScript is a simple set of instructions that you get to create and the computer executes them as if they were reading a sales script.

Scripts are run on very precise instructions so that they can be executed properly.

### Variables
Variables help store information temporarily so that they can be referenced and used later on in the code.

```
var letter;
letter = a;
```

This shows you how to assign a variable.

### Arrays
Arrays allow you to store massive amounts of data or just more than one data but act similarly to variables.

```
var = numbers;
numbers = ['3', '33', '333'];
```

This shows an array holding a set of numbers.


### Three Important Javascript Operators 
1. Numbers (0-9)
2. Strings ('string is just text')
3. Boolean (true or false)

You can manipulate these operators using an operator such as +, -, =, and more.

## Decisons and loops
Decisions and Loops are the bread and butter of the JavaScript language. These JavaScript tools help create function and reactive websites for the web.
